# What-If Scenario Analysis Report

## Scenario Description

This scenario reduces the maximum allowable consumption of material E from 45% to 25%. This constraint will force the optimization model to rely more heavily on other materials (A, B, C, D) to meet the production target. Expected impacts include: potential increase in total costs if material E was cost-effective, changes in collection patterns from sites that primarily supply material E, and possible shifts in the material mix used in production.

### Applied Modifications

- **max_consumption**: Set maximum consumption of material E to 25%
