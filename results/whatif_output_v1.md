## Scenario Description

This scenario reduces the production target by approximately 24% (from 195,000 to 148,000 tons). Expected impacts include: reduced raw material procurement needs across all materials (A-E), lower total freight costs due to decreased material volumes, potential changes in optimal sourcing patterns as some collection sites may become less economical at lower volumes, and overall reduction in total supply chain costs. The facility location and port selection may remain optimal, but the cost structure will scale down proportionally with reduced throughput.

### Applied Modifications

- **production_target**: Change production target from 195,000 tons to 148,000 tons
